# Zombie-War
"The program randomly generates an array of survivors and zombies. Make each survivor attack every zombie. Next, make each zombie attack every survivor. Repeat until all zombie or all survivors are dead. Then print a report of how many survivors made it to safety. A dead survivor or a dead zombie should not attack."
